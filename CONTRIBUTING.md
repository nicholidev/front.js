Remix is a project developed by React Training LLC.

If you'd like to contribute something, whether it's a bug fix to scratch your
own itch or a typo in the docs, we'd be happy to have your contribution. We need
you to sign a contributor license agreement (CLA) first that assigns us
ownership so we are able to include it in this software.

We don't yet have a CLA, but we are working on it and we will be able to accept
your contributions once we do. Until then, please keep letting us know about our
bugs and typos in Discord and we will do our best to address them.

Thank you for your patience!

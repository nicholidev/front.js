Remix is a commercial project developed by React Training LLC.

We do not ask for contributions from our subscribers. After all, that's what
you're paying *us* for. ðŸ˜…

However, if there is something that you'd like to contribute, whether it's a bug
fix to scratch your own itch or a typo that you just can't overlook in the docs,
we'd be happy to have your contribution. But we need you to sign a contributor
license agreement (CLA) first that assigns us ownership so we are able to
include it in the software we sell.

We don't yet have a CLA, but we are working on it and we will be able to accept
your contributions once we do. Until then, please keep letting us know about our
bugs and typos in Discord and we will do our best to address them.

Thank you for your patience!

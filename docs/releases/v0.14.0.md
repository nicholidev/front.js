# v0.14.0 Release Notes

This release includes some significant improvements to the way Remix apps are deployed to production.

## tl;dr

This release reorganizes some fundamental pieces of Remix in an effort to streamline production deploys.

- Remove `@remix-run/cli` from your `dependencies` in `package.json` and replace it with `@remix-run/dev` in your `devDependencies`
- Pass the build to `createRequestHandler({ build })`
- In dev mode, don't watch the `app` directory

## Background

This release addresses a few long-standing structural issues with Remix that should help us realize some of our long-term goals for the project.

Before this release, we had both development and production dependencies in the same package: `@remix-run/core`. Having everything in one package helped us bootstrap the project quickly, but also became a burden over time. For example, as we added features to the Remix compiler, which is only needed in development, the overall size of the dependencies Remix needed in a production deployment grew. So we knew we needed two separate packages for production and development.

Another issue with deploying Remix to production before this release is that it required you to deploy your `remix.config.js` file alongside your `build` directory. Remix would read the config and reconstruct the route hierarchy at runtime so that it knew about any dynamic routes you created using `config.routes`. It would also dynamically `require` all modules needed to run your app, which was a non-starter on hosts like Netlify. So we knew we needed to get rid of all dynamic `require`s in production.

So this release splits up our core dependency and completely alters the way we load modules. No biggie, right? The big winner is that your production deploys are going to be more streamlined and we are laying the groundwork for being able to deploy Remix to more providers.

## Upgrading

Despite the significant changes on our side, upgrading your app from Remix 0.13 should be fairly straightforward.

First, remove `@remix-run/cli` from your `dependencies` in `package.json` and replace it with `@remix-run/dev` in your `devDependencies.

```sh
$ npm remove @remix-run/cli
$ npm add -D @remix-run/dev
```

Going forward, `@remix-run/dev` will contain everything you need to develop a Remix app. It should only ever be in `devDependencies` so it doesn't end up in your production environment. We named it `dev` to help you remember :D

# React Router v6

Remix is built on top of React Router v6. Here are the most common APIs that you'll use in your Remix app:

- [`Outlet`](https://reactrouter.com/docs/components/outlet)
- [`useLocation`](https://reactrouter.com/docs/hooks/use-location)
- [`useNavigate`](https://reactrouter.com/docs/hooks/use-navigate)
- [`useParams`](https://reactrouter.com/docs/hooks/use-params)
- [`useResolvedPath`](https://reactrouter.com/docs/hooks/use-resolved-path)

Most of the other APIs are either used internally by Remix or just aren't commonly needed in your app.

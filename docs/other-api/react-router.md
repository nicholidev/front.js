# React Router v6

Remix is built on top of React Router v6. Here are the most common APIs that you'll use in your Remix app:

- [`Outlet`](https://reactrouter.com/docs/api#outlet)
- [`useLocation`](https://reactrouter.com/docs/api#uselocation)
- [`useNavigate`](https://reactrouter.com/docs/api#usenavigate)
- [`useParams`](https://reactrouter.com/docs/api#useparams)
- [`useResolvedPath`](https://reactrouter.com/docs/api#useresolvedpath)

Most of the other APIs are either used internally by Remix or just aren't commonly needed in your app.

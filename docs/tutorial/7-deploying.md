# Deploying

Remix can be deployed to any JavaScript runtime through "adapters". We maintain a few adapters of popular hosts, but in the future we'll have a guide on how you can build your own adapters for any JavaScript server.

## Adapters

The adapters we currently provide are:

- @remix-run/architect - [AWS via Architect](https://arc.codes)
- @remix-run/express - [Express](https://expressjs.com)
- @remix-run/vercel - [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

In the future we'll also provide adapters for these services:

- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)
- [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

## Starter Template

At the beginning of this tutorial, you selected a starter template. Remix has a built-in, production ready web server, but if you're using a different one just follow the deployment instructions in the README.md of your app and you should be live!

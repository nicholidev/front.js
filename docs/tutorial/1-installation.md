Let's get started! Here's what you'll need:

## Prereqs

1. Your Remix license key:

   - Get it from the [Remix Dashboard](https://remix.run/dashboard).
   - [Buy one](https://remix.run/buy) if you don't have one yet!

2. Node.js v14+. [Get it here](https://nodejs.org)

## Installation

Open up your terminal and type this:

```sh
npx create-remix@latest
```

When it asks which server you want to use, pick "Remix App Server" for this tutorial. You'll notice that there are a lot of options, so you can deploy to any server you want.

Enough chat, let's go!

```sh
cd my-remix-app
remix dev
```

Your new website should be up at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Congrats, you can now add "Remix Developer" to your résumé.

Welcome to Remix! These docs should get you building better websites in no time.

## Getting Started

First things first, do the [Quickstart Tutorial](tutorial/1-installation). When you're done with that, we highly recommend reading the [Routes](guides/routing) guide, nested routes are a big deal in Remix.

We're in beta so the docs are still incomplete but we're working on it!

## Getting help

The [Support](https://remix.run/dashboard/support) page lists several resources to get help, check it out if you're stuck.

We are staying pretty active on the discord server with our preview customers and appreciate all of your feedback and patience.

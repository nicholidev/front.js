# Remix Documentation

Welcome to Remix! We have put our heart and soul into this project. The API is pretty stable now and now we're tightening the screws on this thing. We don't expect more breaking API changes (but no promises ðŸ˜…) as we work toward a 1.0 release. These docs are still a bit incomplete and written in a hurry, but they're good enough to get you moving.

## Getting Started

- Before anything else, do the [Quickstart Tutorial](tutorial/1-installation/), it'll only take a few minutes and will introduce you to the key concepts, conventions, and APIs in Remix.
- Skim the docs, these are the two you'll end up referencing the most:
  - [Application Module APIs](/api/app)
  - [Remix Package](/api/remix)
- Check out the [Remix Philosophy](guides/philosophy)

## Getting help

The [Support](https://remix.run/dashboard/support) page lists several resources to get help, check it out if you're stuck (and you will be, things are changing fast at the moment). We are very active on the [discord server](https://remix.run/dashboard/chat) so you'll probably get help fastest there. Please don't be shy!

And with that, good luck! We hope you love Remix.

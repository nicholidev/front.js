Welcome to Remix! We have put our heart and soul into this project. The API isn't stable yet but it's getting there. We appreciate your patience as we tighten the screws on this thing. We're still in the "suppporter preview" so the docs are incomplete but there good enough to get you moving.

## Getting Started

First things first, do the [Quickstart Tutorial](tutorial/1-installation). After that, we recommend reading the [Remix Philosophy](guides/philosophy).

## Getting help

The [Support](https://remix.run/dashboard/support) page lists several resources to get help, check it out if you're stuck. We are very active on the [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/VBePs6d), during the supporter preview you'll probably get help fastest there. Please don't be shy!

And with that, good luck! We hope you love Remix, even in its early state.

- Conventional files
- Routes (including the nested variety âœ¨)
- Styling
- Database interactions (via `sqlite` and `prisma`)
- Mutations
- Validation
- Authentication
- Error handling: Both unexpected (the dev made a whoopsies) and expected (the end-user made a whoopsies) errors
- SEO with Meta Tags

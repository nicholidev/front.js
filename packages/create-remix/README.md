# Welcome to Remix!

[Remix](https://remix.run) is a web framework that helps you build better
websites with React.

To get started, open a new shell and run:

```sh
$ npm init remix
```

Then follow the prompts you see in your terminal.

For more information about Remix, [visit remix.run](https://remix.run)!

## Note on Versioning

Both `npm init remix` and `npx create-remix` cache scripts aggressively, so in
order to run the latest version of this script, you'll need to use
`npx create-remix@latest`. For this reason, this script is versioned
separately from the rest of Remix and almost never updated.

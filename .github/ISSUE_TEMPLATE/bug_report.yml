        Thank you for helping to improve Remix!

        ## The best but report is a failing test!

        The fastest way to get a bug fixed is to add a failing test and sending
        a Pull Request. **It's usually easy to do with our bug report test
        template**.

        1. Click the "Fork" button
        2. Open up the file [`integration/bug-report-test.ts`](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/blob/dev/integration/bug-report-test.ts) on your machine
        3. Follow the instructions!

        ## I'd rather just report the bug

        That's fine too! Go ahead and fill out this form.

        Please keep in mind that to optimize our time when working on Remix, we
        may close bug reports in the issues tab with little discussion. It's
        easy to spend hours tracking down issues that were actually problems in
        app code and not Remix itself, so we focus on PRs with failing tests
        instead.

        Thanks for your understanding!

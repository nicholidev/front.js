        Thank you for helping to improve Remix!

        ## The best bug report is a failing test!

        The fastest way to get a bug fixed is to add a failing test and send a pull request. **It's usually easy to do with our bug report test template**.

        1. Click the "Fork" button
        2. Open up the file [`integration/bug-report-test.ts`](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/blob/dev/integration/bug-report-test.ts) on your machine
        3. Follow the instructions!

        ## I'd rather just report the bug

        That's fine too! Go ahead and fill out this form.
